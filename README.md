This project implements the search solution for the RE String Search assignment and was not tested with Lachlan's compiler prior to submission.
Usage: java REsearch  'fileName.txt' `< fsmFile.txt >` 'output file' or combined with REcompile; java REcompile "text" | java REsearch 'fileName.txt'

AI was used to help me implement the Dequeue method as well as coach me through the process of reading the fsm. It was also used to explain various concepts along the way such as breaking down the functionality of the double ended queue.

I tested with the example fsm and outputs provided by the lecturer. It handles multiple words and repeated lines but it is case sensitive.
